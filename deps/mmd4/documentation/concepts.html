<h1 id="basicconceptsofmultimarkdown">Basic Concepts of MultiMarkdown</h1>

<h2 id="howdoicreateamultimarkdowndocument">How do I create a MultiMarkdown document?</h2>

<p>The general concept in MultiMarkdown is that it should be easy for someone to
type a plain text file that is human-readable, and then use the MultiMarkdown
program to convert that text file into a more complicated computer language
such as HTML or LaTeX. This allows you to create high quality output without
having to spend hours and hours fiddling with font sizes, margins, etc.</p>

<p>The first step in learning to use MultiMarkdown is to learn how to use
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. MultiMarkdown is an
extension to Markdown, and builds off of the basic fundamentals used in
Markdown.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with the Markdown <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">basics</a> and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> pages.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re familiar with the basics of Markdown, it will be relatively easy
to pick up the advanced features included in MultiMarkdown.</p>

<h2 id="completedocumentsvssnippets">Complete documents vs &#8220;snippets&#8221;</h2>

<p>In order to include metadata information such as a title, the HTML document
created by MultiMarkdown must be &#8220;complete.&#8221; This means that it starts with
something that looks like (for HTML):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you include metadata in your document (with a few exceptions), then you will
generate a complete document. If you don&#8217;t include metadata, then you will
instead generate a &#8220;snippet.&#8221; The snippet will just include the relevant
portion of HTML, but will not include the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>Metadata that is only intended to affect the way MultiMarkdown processes the
output will not trigger a complete document. Currently, this means you can use
<code>Base Header Level</code> or <code>Quotes Language</code> and still output a snippet if you
don&#8217;t include any other metadata.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you include (via [Transclusion]) a file that contains MultiMarkdown metadata, the metadata is stripped before being inserted into the parent document. This is slightly different than the idea of a snippet, but the effect of ignoring the metadata is similar.</p>
