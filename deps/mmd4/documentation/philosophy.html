<h3 id="thephilosophybehindmultimarkdown">The Philosophy Behind MultiMarkdown</h3>

<p>My vision for MultiMarkdown was inspired by my understanding of what made Markdown so wonderful. Markdown is simple. It&#8217;s easy to remember. It&#8217;s intuitive to read. Markdown avoids the &#8220;everything but the kitchen sink&#8221; problem.</p>

<p>My goal for MultiMarkdown is that it should be useable for 80% of the documents that 80% of people write. Obviously that is not a precise estimate, but the idea is that <em>most</em> people can write <em>most</em> of their documents using it. Some people can write everything in MMD. Some people can write very little in MMD. MultiMarkdown (by itself) would not be very good for writing a comic book, for example. It&#8217;s perfect for writing a novel.</p>

<p>A central tenet of MultiMarkdown is that the focus is on <em>content</em>, not <em>presentation</em>. I honestly couldn&#8217;t care whether you want to use Arial, Helvetica, or Comic Sans for your masterpiece. The presentation/styling/appearance is for you to decide. You pick the fonts. You pick the colors. What I care about with MultiMarkdown is that most (not necessarily all) of the <em>meaning</em> of the document is represented &#8212; this is a list, that is a table, this is a top-level heading, etc.</p>

<p>A well written MultiMarkdown document will look reasonably good whether you output to HTML, LaTeX, OpenDocument, etc. It might not look perfect. A page might break at an inopportune place. The title page of a LaTeX document doesn&#8217;t have an exact analogy in HTML. HTML doesn&#8217;t handle page breaks well. </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re writing your thesis, publishing a book, or submitting a document to the board of directors &#8212; by all means write in MultiMarkdown. Focus on the content and overall structure. And when you&#8217;re ready, convert to your desired output format. Proofread. And when you&#8217;re sure that you like what you&#8217;ve got, <em>then</em> focus on the aesthetics. Insert a page break. Tweak fonts. Go wild. But do it in a tool appropriate for the format you&#8217;re using. This might be a good programmer&#8217;s text editor for HTML and CSS. It might be <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>. It might be <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>.</p>

<h4 id="thepurposeofmultimarkdown">The Purpose of MultiMarkdown</h4>

<p>In the years since MultiMarkdown was first released, I&#8217;ve received countless emails of all kinds. A group stands out that seems to point to a philosophical difference between types of users.</p>

<p>Computers are wonderful for doing the tedious sorts of things that humans tend to not enjoy and to suck at. For example, I don&#8217;t want to have to add all the columns in a spreadsheet by hand. That&#8217;s what computers are for. Conversely, I don&#8217;t want to read a novel written by a computer (at least not yet&#8230;)</p>

<p>As applied to MultiMarkdown, it&#8217;s purpose is to handle the tedium of applying repetitive formatting rules to text. For example, having to wrap every single paragraph in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags for a web site is really tedious. The computer should be able to handle that easily.</p>

<p>But the user should still understand <em>why</em> those <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags are necessary. The goal of MultiMarkdown is not to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry your pretty little head about complicated things like HTML or LaTeX.&#8221; The goal is to allow you to learn and appreciate things like HTML and LaTeX without most of the tedium that goes along with marking up a document by hand.</p>

<p>MultiMarkdown is not a magical &#8220;black box&#8221; that converts plain text to HTML with a lot of hand-waving and &#8220;pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.&#8221; Programs that use this approach tend to result in crappy output (e.g. Microsoft products, most apps to create web pages &#8220;for you&#8221;, etc.)</p>

<p>So when you&#8217;re trying to do something fancy, or trying to trouble-shoot a problem, start at the end. Look at the HTML/LaTeX/whatever that is generated and see what&#8217;s going on at a fundamental level. Once you understand that, then look at what MultiMarkdown is doing. I believe you&#8217;ll have an easier time solving problems, and probably learn a thing or two along the way&#8230;.</p>

<h4 id="featurerequests">Feature Requests</h4>

<p>I often get feature requests. Some requests are really good ideas and I implement them. Some are really good ideas and I don&#8217;t implement them. Some, however, miss the point of MultiMarkdown entirely.</p>

<p>I completely understand that somewhere out there, somebody&#8217;s life would be complete if MultiMarkdown had a feature that drew a picture of a bunny after every 15th word of a MultiMarkdown document. But that feature would be absolutely useless to everyone else on the planet. Add enough of those sorts of features, and you end up with Microsoft Word. Which I am sure is the only application that some people are able to use, <em>precisely because</em> it draws bunnies, and even lets you choose which color and breed of bunny to use. And whether the bunny is left- or right-pawed.</p>

<p>I am not going to program MultiMarkdown to draw bunnies.</p>

<p>Instead, if there is something that you wish MultiMarkdown would do, consider the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, make sure the feature you want doesn&#8217;t already exist. Read the documentation. Look at the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-Gallery">Sample Gallery</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>If it&#8217;s not there, consider whether you can &#8220;hijack&#8221; an existing feature. For example, I needed to create a PDF to print a book of poetry. MMD didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;poetry&#8221; feature. But it did have code blocks, which are essentially the same thing, except poetry doesn&#8217;t usually use monospaced fonts. Voila, I used code blocks for all of the poems, and then changed the LaTeX output to refrain from using monospaced fonts when displaying code.</p></li>
<li><p>Still stuck? &#8212; ask for help. The <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/multimarkdown">discussion list</a> is a great place to get help, as is the <a href="http://support.fletcherpenney.net/">support site</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>But before requesting a new feature, honestly ask yourself how many other people need it. Ask yourself why, if it&#8217;s such a great idea, it hasn&#8217;t been implemented yet. </p></li>
<li><p>If your idea isn&#8217;t really useful to other people, then that makes it the <em>perfect</em> opportunity to develop some new skills. Grab a copy of the MultiMarkdown source, and start hacking away to add what you want. Test it out. If it&#8217;s really great, share it on the discussion list to let others use it. Convince everyone that it simply <em>must</em> be added to the core source.</p></li>
</ol>
