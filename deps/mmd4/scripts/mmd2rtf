# Pass arguments on to the binary to convert text to OpenDocument

# NOTE:  MultiMarkdown's RTF support is limited at best.  If you find
# 	something that isn't working properly, submit code for a proposed 
#	fix via github or email.  But don't just send a message letting me
#	know it isn't working. ;)
#
# Be sure to include multimarkdown in our PATH
